# Sieve_of_React
My first React project.


After cloning the repository, run the command "mvn verify" from inside the "Sieve_of_React" directory, then "cd frontend" and run "npm install."

To start the Spring server, run "mvn spring-boot:run" from the "Sieve_of_React" directory.

To start Node, run "npm start" from inside the "frontend" directory.
